# â–· Quotex Affiliate Program Review -- Earn up to 80% Commission

## How Does the Quotex Affiliate Program Work?

Quotex pays its affiliates a certain commission ---up to 80% of the
broker\'s profit or 5% of the trading volume--- by promoting a unique
referral link, and attracting new traders to the platform. The more
first-time depositors (FTDs) you generate in a given month, the higher
your commission rate will be from next month on.

Quotex doesn't issue commissions on cost per acquisition (CPA) and cost
per lead (CPL) basis, which are common commissions models on other
online trading affiliate programs.

  Affiliate Level   Required Monthly FTDs   Revenue Share   Turnover Share

## What are the Withdrawal Methods for Quotex Affiliates?

Quotex Affiliate Center supports several withdrawal methods, but most of
them are cryptocurrency-based or require an e-wallet registration. Below
is the full list of available withdrawal methods:

-   Visa
-   Mastercard
-   Bitcoin
-   USDT (TRC20/ERC20)
-   Ethereum
-   Perfect Money
-   PIX
-   GCash
-   Banks of Indonesia
-   Banks of Thailand
-   Banks of Malaysia
-   Other local banks

Quotex supports popular local banks in South-East Asian countries
mostly, but since the company is offshore, your payout transaction is
not guaranteed to be seamless, especially if you use a credit card. So
avoid using bank cards, online banking, or offline deposits and use
cryptocurrencies and e-wallets instead.

Payouts are issued every week, but you can only request your first
payout once you refer 10 FTDs to the platform.

## Does Quotex Pay its Affiliates?

Since Quotex affiliates bring a huge amount of new traders to the
platform, Quotex pays its affiliates more than \$5 million in total
every week.

However, we have to warn you that \[Quotex is an unregulated
broker\](https://eseta.org.za/quotex/), with many users complaining
about \[sudden account
suspensions\](https://eseta.org.za/quotex/blocked-account/) and
\[declined withdrawal
requests\](https://eseta.org.za/quotex/withdrawal/). This means that
there is no regulatory oversight over how the broker operates, and you
can't do anything if Quotex decides to suspend your affiliate account
and never pay your earned commissions.

For this reason, we don't recommend you sign up as a Quotex affiliate,
as we think that other similar options, like the \[Olymp Trade affiliate
program\](https://eseta.org.za/olymp-trade/affiliate-program/) or the
\[IQ Option affiliate
program\](https://eseta.org.za/iq-option/affiliate-program/), are much
more reliable.

### Direct Links

Quotex also provides direct links to their landing pages, signup pages,
homepages, and banners that you add to your referrals. These generated
links will reflect on your revenue-sharing commission.

### Sub-affiliate Program

Sub-affiliate program allows you to recruit people to join the program
and earn a percentage of their commission. The commission rate you
receive from your recruits depends on your affiliate level, meaning
higher levels might earn a larger share of your sub-affiliates'
earnings. Here's the rate you get from your sub-affiliates based on your
level:
